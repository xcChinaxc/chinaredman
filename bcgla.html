                                <p>A journey from WordPress to AirTable. From creating databases and content submission forms to handling AirTable API integration to bring my client's vision to life.</p>
                                <h3>Project Purpose and Goal</h3>
                                <p>The goal was simple: finish the client-owned WordPress site.</p>
                                <p>While we were making progress on the WordPress site, I felt as if I was setting my client up for failure. I knew they would not have the time, energy, or patience to continue learning WordPress to keep up with uploading resources during a conventional semester. So, I focused on finding easy-to-use low-code tools to make this work for them and their team!</p>
                                <h3>Spotlight</h3>
                                <span>We decided on the AirTable and Softr combination because:</span>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>felt familiar and less imitating than WordPress</li>
                                    <li>granted content management for the newsletter and the website in one system</li>
                                    <li>provided Black Caucus members the ability to submit ideas via the content submission form</li>
                                    <li>empowered Black Caucus leadership to make website updates</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Let's <a href="/#contact">chat</a> about the details of this project, or you can explore the <a href="https://blackcaucusgla.softr.io/">site</a> yourself. Either way, I hope to hear from you!</p>
