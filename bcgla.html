                                <span class="image main"><img src="images/bcgla_home.jpeg" alt="Homepage Image. Cartoonish image of a woman reading on three large books to the left. Black Caucus Interest Group in large black font on the right."></span>
                                <h2>GLA's Black Caucus Interest Group</h2>
                                <p>This project is a Softr application that uses AirTable's API to distribute newsletters, professional development opportunities, and other resources to BIPOC librarians and library paraprofessionals.</p>
                                <h3>Project Purpose and Goal</h3>
                                <p>The goal was simple: finish the client-owned WordPress site.</p>
                                <p>While we were making progress on the WordPress site, I felt like I was setting my client up for failure. I knew they would not have the time, energy, or patience to continue learning WordPress to keep up with uploading resources during a conventional semester. So, I focused on finding easy-to-use low-code tools to make this work for them and their team!</p>
                                <h3>Spotlight</h3>
                                <span>We decided on the AirTable and Softr combination because:</span>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>felt familiar and less imitating than WordPress</li>
                                    <li>granted content management for the newsletter and the website in one system</li>
                                    <li>provided Black Caucus members the ability to submit ideas via the content submission form</li>
                                    <li>empowered Black Caucus leadership to make website updates</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                                <p>As a library paraprofessional, I'm used to patrons asking for what they <i>think</i> they need vs. what they <i>actually</i> need. As a freelance developer, I feel as though I initially failed to do that.</p>
                                <p>My client thought they needed their WordPress site completed, but what they actually needed was someone to sit down, listen to their problem, and find the technology they needed to make things a bit easier.</p>
